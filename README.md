Bicep Curl and Plank Posture Tracker: Developed a computer vision system using Mediapipe and OpenCV to accurately track and count bicep curls and correct posture during planks. Provided real-time feedback to users for correct exercise performance and injury prevention.


## Features

- Real-time posture correction
- Accurate bicep curl counting
- Mediapipe and OpenCV
- Cross platform

## Methodology: 

The system uses computer vision technology with Mediapipe and OpenCV to track the movement of the user's arms and body during bicep curls and planks. The camera captures the video of the user's movement, which is then processed by the algorithm to count the number of bicep curls performed and to detect any deviations in the user's posture during a plank. The algorithm also provides feedback to the user, correcting their posture in real-time.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Deepti-Hegde-DH/AI-gym-trainer.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd AI-gym-trainer
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Impact

This project has the potential to revolutionize the fitness industry by providing an effective, accurate, and convenient solution for tracking exercise performance. With the ability to correct posture in real-time, users can be confident that they are performing exercises correctly and avoiding potential injuries.

## Future Work

The project can be expanded to include tracking of additional exercises and to provide more comprehensive feedback and analysis. Additionally, the system can be integrated with wearable devices and fitness apps to provide a more seamless and integrated experience for users.
